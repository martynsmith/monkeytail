Description: tail variant designed for web developers monitoring logfiles
 MonkeyTail allows a user to tail multiple files on both local and remote hosts
 and clearly marks inactivity by putting 5 newlines in the output whenever a
 pause in output over 3 seconds is detected.
 .
 MonkeyTail is implemented a fairly simple wrapper script around standard tail,
 ssh, and sudo.

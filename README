Overview
--------
MonkeyTail allows a user to tail multiple files on both local and remote hosts
and clearly marks inactivity by putting 5 newlines in the output whenever a
pause in output over 3 seconds is detected.

MonkeyTail is implemented a fairly simple wrapper script around standard tail,
ssh, and sudo.

Dependancies
------------
Perl modules
    * IO::Handle
    * Event
    * Getopt::Declare
    * Config::General

These are available as Debian packages (in etch at least)
    * perl-base (which you probably already have)
    * libevent-perl
    * libgetopt-declare-perl
    * libconfig-general-perl

Usage
-----

Usage: ./mtail [options]  <file>...
       ./mtail -help
       ./mtail -version

Options:

    -q                  Quiet mode
    --quiet               "    "

    <file>...           Files to tail, see --help for how to specify sudo/remote files

    Files to tail can be specified in the following ways ...

     * <filename>               - tails a local file.

     * +<filename>              - attempts to sudo and tail a local file (will prompt
                                  for pwd if required).

     * <remotehost>:<filename>  - attempts to invoke tail via ssh on a remote host.

     * +<remotehost>:<filename> - attempts to invoke sudo tail via ssh on a
                                  remote host (will prompt for pwd if required).
